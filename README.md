Fsharp Langton ant

The goal would be to fit it in a tweet to Fsibot, but I need more help I think, because I'm at the end of my brains capacity, I've started tapping into @glorp but I don't know if even he can do it.

Since the code is a bit short, some comments might help

b = the set of black points on the board

d = direction, the direction of the ant

(x,y) = point, obviously

(100,100) = starting point

15000 - number of iterations (it's only repeating itself at this point, so no point in going higher)
